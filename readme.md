# AndroidIDE Theme Store

Download color schemes and themes from [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?excludeTags=internal&tags=Theme) and [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Installs) to apply them in [AndroidIDE](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE).

**This project is currently in rapid development and thus I do not accept any pull requests.**

The goal of this project is to practice development with Jetpack Compose, Dagger/Hilt DI and modern design patterns.
